# Introduction

Relation extraction is a natural language processing task which deals with the identification of mentioned real-world entities (such as persons, organizations and places) and their expressed relations. Relation extraction is composed of several subtasks: Entities need to be identified and related to categories (Named Entity Recognition and Tagging) in the first place, so that possible relations can be determined (Relation Extraction). This also includes the need for co-reference resolution, as related entities can be referenced by anaphoric expressions. Depending on the features to be used in these tasks, previous processing might be necessary, e.g. tokenization, parsing or part-of-speech tagging.

In addition to the described sequentiality of these subtasks, it seems plausible to also suggest mutual dependencies between them. For example, if we know that a "lives-in" relation holds between two entities A and B, we can be relatively confident that A is a person and B is a place of some kind. Likewise, if we know two entities are an organization and a place, we can infer that only a subset of all possible relations can hold between them. The same is true for anaphora resolution, for example if we know that the anaphora is part of a relation that only applies to persons.

Different approaches vary in the way in which they deal with these relations between tasks. On the one hand, there are pipeline approaches which model the subtasks as a series of consecutive models, each passing its output as input to the sequential model. On the other hand, there are joint inference models, that try to explicitly model the mutual dependencies between the subtasks. In the following, I would like to present an example for each type and detail their principle design and central characteristics (section 2). I will then discuss their differences and similarities in regard to a number of aspects (section 3) to conclude with a few remarks on potential improvements and alternatives (section 4).
