# Conclusion

- What is your opinion on these papers? Which aspects are
most interesting? Can you identify drawbacks/potential for
improvements? Do you see different or related problems for
these approaches?

- further compare different features used by Mintz et al. and Singh et al.

- combine distant supervision and joint inference

- instead of careful feature engineering deep learning for relation extraction which models dependency between entity
tags, relations and coreference

- data programming ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723 ) as alternative for distant supervision
